# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset used contains real transactions, where each transaction is labeled as legitimate or fraudulent.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and exploring the dataset.

Imbalanced Data Handling: Addressing class imbalance since fraud cases are rare.

Machine Learning Model: Logistic Regression is used for fraud classification.

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy score is used to assess model performance.

Dataset

The dataset contains anonymized credit card transactions.

Each transaction is labeled as 0 (legit) or 1 (fraudulent).
